This is my custom brave startup page. One file called `weather.js` in the scripts folder is missing. That file is responsible for the weather widget. The reason for that is it contains my API key for OpenWeather and I'm too lazy to setup a proper way to hide it. This means you need to make it on your own. Good Luck
